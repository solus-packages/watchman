        <Summary xml:lang="en">Watches files and records, or triggers actions, when they change</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Watchman exists to watch files and record when they actually change. It can
also trigger actions (such as rebuilding assets) when matching files change

* Watchman can recursively watch one or more directory trees (we call them
roots)
* Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up
the same as any other file in its reporting
* Watchman waits for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger
notifications or command execution
* Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it
considers files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when
it is unsure
* You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the
current state of the tree
* You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root
