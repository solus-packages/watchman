summary    : Watches files and records, or triggers actions, when they change
description: |
    Watchman exists to watch files and record when they actually change. It can
    also trigger actions (such as rebuilding assets) when matching files change

    * Watchman can recursively watch one or more directory trees (we call them
    roots)
    * Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up
    the same as any other file in its reporting
    * Watchman waits for a root to settle down before it will start to trigger
    notifications or command execution
    * Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution; it
    considers files to be freshly changed when you start to watch them or when
    it is unsure
    * You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the
    current state of the tree
    * You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root
